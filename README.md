# My First Website
I was inspired by Emily Vu, who replicated her resume to look like Spotify.
I found that this would be a good challenge to brush up on my HTML, CSS, and Python. I am running the site on PythonAnywhere using Flask. I am continuing to work on it.
## Currently working on:
- [] Adding a playbar at the footer of the page.
- [] A Landing page
